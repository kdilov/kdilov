# Konstantin Dilov

Software Engineering graduate with hands-on experience building tools and automation for engineering teams at Cirrus Logic. I developed Python utilities and dashboards that the team adopted into their daily workflow, migrated 1,000+ legacy wiki pages to Confluence, and automated security checks across the Atlassian stack. I also deliver data extraction tools and browser automation for freelance clients. I enjoy creating software that solves real problems and makes people's work easier.
